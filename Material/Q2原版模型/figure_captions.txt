## Figure 1: Multi-Model Comparison (fig_model_comparison.png)
This figure compares fan vote weight estimates across five different analytical methods.
Key findings:
- Rank Method: Fan weights cluster around 50-75%, indicating balanced influence
- Percentage Method: Fan weights are consistently higher (52-91%)
- All models confirm that the Percentage Method gives more weight to fan votes

## Figure 2: Bootstrap Distribution (fig_bootstrap_distribution.png)
Bootstrap resampling (n=1000) provides confidence intervals for weight estimates.
(a) Rank Method: Mean = 50.68%, 95% CI covers 50%, supporting balanced hypothesis
(b) Percentage Method: Mean = 60.32%, 95% CI above 50%, confirming fan dominance

## Figure 3: Shapley Value Analysis (fig_shapley_analysis.png)
Game-theoretic fair attribution of predictive contribution.
(a) Rank Method: Judge 39.0%, Fan 61.0%
(b) Percentage Method: Judge 30.7%, Fan 69.3%
Shapley values provide a principled, axiomatic approach to contribution allocation.

## Figure 4: Logistic Regression Analysis (fig_logistic_analysis.png)
(a) ROC curves show Fan Vote alone (AUC=0.760) outperforms Judge Score alone (AUC=0.669)
(b) Relative influence analysis confirms fan votes are the dominant factor in elimination

## Figure 5: Robustness Analysis (fig_robustness_analysis.png)
(a) Noise sensitivity: 5% noise causes only 0.09% AUC drop, demonstrating strong robustness
(b) Feature perturbation: Fan vote provides higher predictive power than judge score

## Figure 6: Validation Summary (fig_validation_summary.png)
(a) Heatmap shows consistent patterns across all models
(b) Radar plot displays cross-validation metrics
(c) Bootstrap CI demonstrates estimation stability (CV < 1%)
(d) Model comparison highlights complementary strengths
