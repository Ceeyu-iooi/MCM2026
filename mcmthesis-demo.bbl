      \field{abstract}{There exist many fields where inverse problems appear. Some examples are: astronomy (blurred images of the Hubble satellite), econometrics (instrumental variables), financial mathematics (model calibration of the volatility), medical image processing (X-ray tomography), and quantum physics (quantum homodyne tomography). These are problems where we have indirect observations of an object (a function) that we want to reconstruct, through a linear operator A. Due to its indirect nature, solving an inverse problem is usually rather difficult. For this reason, one needs regularization methods in order to get a stable and accurate reconstruction. We present the framework of statistical inverse problems where the data are corrupted by some stochastic error. This white noise model may be discretized in the spectral domain using Singular Value Decomposition ({SVD}), when the operator A is compact. Several examples of inverse problems where the {SVD} is known are presented (circular deconvolution, heat equation, tomography). We explain some basic issues regarding nonparametric statistics applied to inverse problems. Standard regularization methods and their counterpart as estimation procedures by use of {SVD} are discussed (projection, Landweber, Tikhonov, . . . ). Several classical statistical approaches like minimax risk and optimal rates of convergence, are presented. This notion of optimality leads to some optimal choice of the tuning parameter. However these optimal parameters are unachievable since they depend on the unknown smoothness of the function. This leads to more recent concepts like adaptive estimation and oracle inequalities. Several data-driven selection procedures of the regularization parameter are discussed in details, among these: model selection methods, Stein’s unbiased risk estimation and the recent risk hull method.}

      \field{abstract}{With the development of technology and the times, how to promote China to move toward a more advanced digital development path has become a hot topic. To promote the development of the digital economy, the government has introduced a series of documents and policies to guide enterprises to increase investment in digital transformation and improve the application level of digital technologies. Against this background, more and more enterprises are taking digital transformation as the main direction for future development and actively seeking to implement digital strategies. Digital transformation can help enterprises reduce product costs and improve operational efficiency. At the same time, through organizational change, process reengineering, and business growth, enterprises can more efficiently respond to industry competition. This paper focuses on the issue of “financial performance evaluation of manufacturing enterprises under the background of digital transformation,” and selects Haier Smart Home, a leading company in the home appliance industry, to establish a financial performance evaluation system to explore whether digital transformation has a positive impact on the company's financial performance. First, this study uses relevant theoretical knowledge of digital transformation and financial performance to analyze the motivation, process, and impact of Haier Smart Home's digital transformation on its financial performance. Second, the case study selects multiple financial indicators of Haier Smart Home from 2012 to 2022, covering development ability, operational ability, solvency, and profitability, analyzing their development trends, and comparing them with other companies in the industry. Furthermore, the study applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Grey Relational Analysis to comprehensively evaluate the company’s financial performance, calculating the weights of primary and secondary financial performance indicators, and multiplying them with the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix to obtain the overall financial performance level.}
